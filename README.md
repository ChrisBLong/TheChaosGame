A simple JavaScript/HTML5 implementation of the classic fractal-generating algorithm.

This page was created for this YouTube video: https://youtu.be/rL2R-QJlAt0 

It's deliberately very simple, and in fact contains a lot more CSS than I would have liked, but that was necessary to ensure that the page works for as many people as possible on phones, tablets and other devices.

It would be possible to create a much simpler page containing just a <canvas> element and with the JavaScript declared in-line. As stated in the video, I think this could be a great way for people to learn more about coding without having to rely on additional applications or frameworks.
